Create a simple drag-and-drop game for toddlers (ages 2–3) on iPad, based on the following requirements:

🎮 Game Description:
- Each level shows:
  - One draggable image (e.g., a cat).
  - 10 silhouette (shadow) targets at the top of the screen.
- The child must drag the image to the correct shadow.

🧠 Game Logic:
1. At the start of each level:
   - Display one colored image (draggable) at the bottom.
   - Display multiple shadow targets above (1 correct + 2–3 decoys).
2. On drag and drop:
   - If correct:
     - Play a "success" sound (e.g., applause or "Great job!"). 
     - Read the item name aloud in English (e.g., "Cat", "Apple").
     - Show a simple visual effect (sparkles, fireworks).
     - After ~1 second, load the next image and new shadows.
   - If incorrect:
     - Play a gentle "wrong" sound (e.g., "Try again!").
     - Reset the image to its original position.

3. End of topic:
   - After all images are completed, show a celebratory screen.
   - Offer options to replay or choose a new topic.

📁 Assets & Structure:
- Each topic (Animals, Fruits, Vehicles, etc.) contains:
  - Colored PNG images (transparent background).
  - Matching shadow PNGs (gray or black).
  - Example folder:
    /Assets/Topics/Animals/
      - cat.png
      - cat_shadow.png
      - dog_shadow.png
      - rabbit_shadow.png

- Each level loads:
  - 1 image
  - 1 correct shadow
  - 2–3 distractor shadows from the same topic

🔊 Sound Files:
- correct.mp3 – success sound
- wrong.mp3 – fail sound
- (optional) voice_<name>.mp3 – spoken prompts like “This is a cat!”

🖼 UI Design:
- Full iPad screen (4:3 aspect ratio, e.g., 2048x1536)
- Top: shadow drop targets spaced evenly
- Bottom: draggable image
- No text; use voice prompts and icons
- Gentle background color
- Top-left corner: "Back" button (for parents)

🛠 Technical Requirements:
- Built with either:
  - HTML5 + Phaser.js – for browser-based version
- Code should be clean, modular, and extensible
- New images should be loadable from folder without modifying code
- Optimized for iPad touch input
- Support basic audio and animation feedback

🎯 Goal:
Provide a starter project including:
- 1 sample topic (3 images, each with 3 shadows)
- Working drag-and-drop logic
- Next image loads on correct match
- iPad-compatible build
